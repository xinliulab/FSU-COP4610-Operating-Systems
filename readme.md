This repository hosts teaching materials for **COP 4610: Operating Systems** at Florida State University. It is used to share lecture slides, demo code, and project scaffolding so students can practice real system-level programming in C and Linux. The course covers virtualization, concurrency, and persistence, and connects OS concepts to real systems like data centers, HPC, and AI platforms.

## What’s inside
- **Slides**: PDF decks aligned with the course calendar.
- **In-class demos**: Small, focused programs that illustrate system calls, memory, processes, threads, synchronization, filesystems, and drivers.
- **Projects and scaffolds**: Starters and test harnesses for multi-week programming assignments.

For the current semester’s syllabus, schedule, and links to slides and code, see the course website. <https://xinliulab.github.io/FSU-COP4610-Operating-Systems/>


## Acknowledgments

- **Primary textbook**: *Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces* (OSTEP), a free online textbook by Remzi H. Arpaci-Dusseau and Andrea C. Arpaci-Dusseau. We are deeply grateful for making such a high-quality OS text freely available to students and instructors.  
  <http://ostep.org>

- **Inspiration and open courseware**: Prof. **Yanyan Jiang** (Nanjing University). His excellent online OS course and publicly shared code examples greatly influenced the design of our in-class demos and the way we present state-machine thinking in OS education.
